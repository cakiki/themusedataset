[**Toward a Musical Sentiment (MuSe) Dataset for
Affective Distant Hearing**](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/short26.pdf)

>*Abstract:* In this short paper we present work in progress that tries to leverage crowdsourced music metadata
>and crowdsourced affective word norms to create a comprehensive dataset of music emotions, which
>can be used for sentiment analyses in the music domain. We combine a mixture of different data
>sources to create a new dataset of 90,408 songs with their associated embeddings in Russell’s model
>of affect, with the dimensions valence, dominance and arousal. In addition, we provide a Spotify ID
>for the songs, which can be used to add more metadata to the dataset via the Spotify API.
